How To Start
-Identify content.



HTML 
- Content is wrapped in "tags"
-tages tell the browser the meaning of the content
-browsers displays the content according to the rules of the tages
-This is called "marking up" the content
-Ergo: Hyper Text Markup Language

Tags
-Tages surround the content they describe. Like thisL
   <p>My really cool paragraph!</p>

Organize your content 
- HTML has tags that are applied to blocks of content.
--<header></header>
--<nav></nav>

White space
-white sspace = tabs, spaces, returns
-all white space characters show up as one space.
-We can use different tags to make

headings 
-tells the browser how important a line of text is
	-<h1>I;m the biggest heading!</h1>

Attributes
-tags can ahave attributes that give more info
	- where to find an imgage file
	- the URL of a link
-attributes have different names, nit the syntax is the same:
	-<image src
